  <GeckoDetails details="Leopard geckos are nocturnal, ground-dwelling geckos that can be found in desert environments in Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and parts of India. They are generally docile and easy to tame. They do not have the sticky toe pads like other geckos, so they do not climb walls, but unlike other geckos, they do have eyelids."></LeoGeckoDetails>
